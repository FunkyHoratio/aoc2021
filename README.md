Advent of Code 2021 Solutions in Rust

## Day 1
Setup Rust in Windows Subsytem for Linux
Setup Visual Studio Code

rustc day1_1_main.rs
./day1_1_main
rustc day1_2_main.rs
./day1_2_main

I'm unwrapping a bunch of things and I don't know why? It's something to do with a Result object...
Stole a line reader function from the internet. Don't tell anyone.
Ugh. Strongly typed variables.
My implementation is clunky for the sliding window, but I don't know how to array/vector yet!
Got both stars.

## Day 2
Discovered Cargo and package managment. Yay package library!
Attempted regex and learning error handling in a not unrelated way.
